<h5><b>Join us for the upcoming Spring 2024 Responsible AI 
Research Program Showcase!</b></h5>

**When:** Friday, May 10th, 2024, 10am-noon EDT (GMT-4, NY, USA) / 17-19 EEST
(GMT+3, Ukraine)

**Where:** <a href="https://nyu.zoom.us/j/93401500375">Zoom</a>

The program is run by the Center for Responsible AI at the Tandon
School of Engineering at New York University, in close collaboration
with Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, Ukraine.  Its goals are to
help build research capacity in Ukraine, both generally in STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and specifically
in the critically important area of Responsible AI, and to catalyze
the integration of Ukrainian researchers into the global research
community.

In Spring 2024, 20 Ukrainian students continued to work on 11
exciting research projects under the mentorship of academic experts
from universities in the United States and Europe.  Join us to
learn more about their expecting work on algorithmic fairness,
interpretability and explainability, privacy and data protection, data
management for machine learning, causal inference, and evaluation and
benchmarking.
