Earlier this month, the **NYU's Center for Responsible AI** and **Center for Robotics and Embodied Intelligence** co-hosted a landmark three-day event across <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/">NYU Tandon</a> and the **United Nations Headquarters**, organized in partnership with the <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org">United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA)</a> and <a href="https://www.sipri.org/">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)</a>. Held under the EU-funded initiative 'Promoting Responsible Innovation in AI for Peace and Security,' the event convened global experts from academia, civil society, and international policy to examine how civilian AI technologies--often developed without peace and security in mind--can be better governed through education, awareness, and policy.

The program opened on **May 7** with a research showcase at NYU's Center for Robotics and Embodied Intelligence, where robotics and responsible AI researchers presented posters, robots, short films, and more. Attendees explored the stations, gaining firsthand insight into ongoing research. The event continued with a public panel featuring Julia Stoyanovich (NYU), Virginia Dignum (Umeå University), Peter Asaro (The New School), Vincent Boulanin (SIPRI), and moderator Charles Ovink (UNODA). The discussion focused on the dual-use risks of AI and the need to equip practitioners to recognize and address them—particularly through STEM education.

<p>On **May 8**, faculty, Ph.D. students, and experts from around the world gathered for a full-day workshop focused on integrating responsible innovation into technical curricula. Insights from this workshop will inform both a set of policy recommendations that UNODA and SIPRI will present to states and international organizations, and a forthcoming Handbook on Promoting Responsible AI Innovation for Peace and Security, to be published later this year.<p>

<p>**May 9** culminated at the United Nations with small-group discussions and a high-level dialogue with UN leaders, including Amandeep Singh Gill (UN Tech Envoy), Maritza Chan Valverde (Chair, UNGA First Committee), and Adedeji Ebo (Director, UNODA), centering on how to embed responsible AI education into global governance frameworks.<p>

<p>Across the event, a unifying message stood out: meaningful AI innovation requires more than technical progress—it demands alignment with human values, public accountability, and responsible education. The **Center for Responsible AI** is continuing this work alongside our global partners and expanding our efforts across research, education, and policy.<p>
