The R/AI Rockstar series aims to improve the representation of women and members of historically under-represented groups in AI careers. We do this by bringing role models who work on RAI topics and contribute to the diversity of voices in this area of research, education, and practice. The second Rockstar in this series, [**Dr. Moshe Y. Vardi**](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/moshe-y-vardi), will visit NYU R/AI in February 2023.

#### TALK: How to be an Ethical Computer Scientist
Many of us got involved in computing because programming was fun. The advantages of computing seemed intuitive to us. We truly believed that computing yields tremendous societal benefits; for example, the life-saving potential of driverless cars is enormous! Recently, however, computer scientists realized that computing is not a game — it is real — and it brings with it not only societal benefits, but also significant societal costs, such as labor polarization, disinformation, and smart-phone addiction. A common reaction to this crisis is to label it as an “ethics crisis”. But corporations are driven by profits, not ethics, and machines are just machines. Only people can be expected to act ethically. In this talk the speaker will discuss how computer scientists should behave ethically.

Date & Time: Friday, February 10, 2023, 11 am-12 pm
Venue: [**NYU Center for Data Science, 60 5th Avenue, Room 150, New York, NY 10011**](https://goo.gl/maps/WmD4vf1pwDhxFaey8)

The talk will be followed by a reception in the 7th-floor open area.
