Responsible AI at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York
University, in close collaboration with Ukrainian Catholic University
in Lviv, Ukraine.  Its goals are to help build research capacity in
Ukraine, both generally in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and specifically in the critically important area of
Responsible AI, and to catalyze the integration of Ukrainian
researchers into the global research community.

In Fall 2024, 39 Ukrainian students mentored by 29 academic experts from
universities in the United States and Europe will present their research projects to the community. <a
