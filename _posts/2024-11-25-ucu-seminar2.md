### John Doe meets Jane Doe: Text Anonymization for Responsible Natural Language Processing


**Abstract:** 
How can we effectively work with user-generated texts without compromising user data privacy? In this talk, we will discuss text anonymization as a responsible AI practice designed to protect sensitive user data while maintaining the usability of data for research and application purposes. We will explore text anonymization use cases, types of anonymization, implementation techniques, and anonymization benchmarks, as well as language-specific nuances of text anonymization. With this talk, my goal is to empower the Natural Language Processing community to embrace methodologies that balance innovation with privacy, fostering a data landscape that is not only advanced but also ethically sound.


A big thank you to **Tetiana Zakharchenko** for co-hosting and organizing the event!

The meet-up is set for **November 28 at 6:00 PM in Kyiv and online**.
