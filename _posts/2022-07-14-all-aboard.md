In Spring 2021, the All Aboard! project, funded by the [NSF Northeast
Big Data
Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/seed-fund-about/#education-data),
brought together data scientists, disability scholars and activists
and social scientists to devise new workflows for making public
education on AI and data science more accessible. The group used the
existing public education portfolio of the NYU Center for Responsible
AI as material for the discussions. In three separate gatherings,
selected comics, and videos of the We Are AI course
([https://dataresponsibly.github.io/we-are-ai/)](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/we-are-ai/)
served as concrete use cases. The discussions that evolved around
these concrete use cases form the basis for this primer.

We hope that the All Aboard! primer will continue to create synergies
between the typically distant domains of data science, art, social
science and disability studies and activism in order to propel
democratic deliberation around AI and data science forward in an
accessible and equitable way. We also hope that it will have effects
on how data scientists, educators, and government institutions think
about and practically engage in deliberation around AI and data
science regulation.

The result of this work is our [All Aboard!
primer](http://r-ai.co/AllAboard) on making AI education accessible,
produced in partnership with the [NYU Tandon Ability
Project](http://ability.nyu.edu/).
