[RAIforUkraine](/RAIforUkraine/#) is a program is run by the Center
for Responsible AI at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York
University, in close collaboration with Ukrainian Catholic University
in Lviv, Ukraine.  Its goals are to help build research capacity in
Ukraine, both generally in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and specifically in the critically important area of
Responsible AI, and to catalyze the integration of Ukrainian
researchers into the global research community.

In Fall 2022, 13 research fellows from the Ukrainian Catholic
University and other universities from Ukraine collaborated with
faculty and graduate students from New York University, the University
of Washington, and the University of Edinburgh in 6 research projects
on Responsible AI through the Fall 2022 semester.  The semester
concluded with a virtual showcase of the research projects.
