NYU’s Institute for Public Knowledge, the NYU Center for Responsible AI, the 370 Jay Project, and the NYU Tandon Department of Technology, Culture and Society invite you to a discussion on religion in the series “Co-Opting AI.” This event will explore how AI technologies have changed the narratives and rationalities that underpin assisted reproduction, from early feminist initiatives to the commercialization of pregnancy, as well as the tactics used in scientific research on human reproduction. It will consider how these dynamics map onto racial disparities and wider inequalities in public health and beyond.
