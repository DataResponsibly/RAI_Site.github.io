Unfinished Live 2021: The Future is Decentralized convened technologists, journalists, thought leaders, artists, and changemakers to tackle one of the most consequential opportunities of our time: harnessing ethical digital tech to build a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

The festival took place at The Shed in New York City on September 23-24 and included two days of dynamic mainstage talks, Clubhouse conversations, live podcasts, networking, and interactive exhibits — hosted by author and futurist Baratunde Thurston.
