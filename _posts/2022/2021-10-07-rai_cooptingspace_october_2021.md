NYU’s Institute for Public Knowledge, the NYU Center for Responsible AI, the 370 Jay Project, and the NYU Tandon Department of Technology, Culture and Society invite you to a discussion on games in the series “Co-Opting AI.” This event will examine how imaginaries of space and space exploration are entangled with technological innovation, and AI in particular. The discussion will also consider the social, political and economic impacts of that entanglement.
