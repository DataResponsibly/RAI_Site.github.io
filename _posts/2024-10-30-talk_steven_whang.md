Professor <a href="https://stevenwhang.com">Steven Euijong Whang</a> visited NYU R/AI on October 30, 2024, and gave a talk on his recent work.

#### **Recent Advances in Data-centric Responsible AI and the NYU-KAIST Collaboration**

**Abstract:** Data-centric Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. In addition to improving a model’s accuracy, it is important to improve other aspects including fairness, robustness, privacy, explainability, value alignment, and more. These objectives not only need to be satisfied during model training, but in all steps of machine learning starting from the data. In this seminar, I will talk about three recent works from our lab towards this goal: (1) Falcon: fair active learning for data labeling (VLDB’24), (2) RC-Mixup: robust data augmentation for regression tasks (KDD’24), and (3) ERBench: an LLM hallucination benchmark using relational databases (NeurIPS’24 Spotlight). I will also introduce our recent Global AI Frontier Lab collaboration with NYU under the project titled “AI Guardians: Development of Robust, Controllable, and Unbiased Trustworthy AI Technology”.

**Speaker's bio:** <a href="https://stevenwhang.com">Steven Euijong Whang</a> is an associate professor with tenure at KAIST EE and AI and leads the Data Intelligence Lab.
