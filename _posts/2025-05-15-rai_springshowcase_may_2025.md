<h5><b>Another Semester of the Responsible AI for Ukraine Program Wraps Up with a Project Showcase!</b></h5>



[RAIforUkraine](/RAIforUkraine/#) is a program run by the Center for
Responsible AI at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York
University, in close collaboration with Ukrainian Catholic University
in Lviv, Ukraine.  Its goals are to help build research capacity in
Ukraine, both generally in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and specifically in the critically important area of
Responsible AI, and to catalyze the integration of Ukrainian
researchers into the global research community.

In Spring 2025, 37 Ukrainian students mentored by 19 academic experts from
universities in the United States and Europe have diligently worked on 10 research projects and presented them to the community on May, 15.
