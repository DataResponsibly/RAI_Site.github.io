Research Program Showcase!</b></h5>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, December 19th, 2024, 9am-11:30 EDT (GMT-4, NY, USA) / 16-18:30 EEST
(GMT+3, Ukraine)</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://nyu.zoom.us/j/97688526231">Zoom</a></p>

<p><a href="/RAIforUkraine/#">RAIforUkraine</a> is a program run by the Center for
Responsible AI at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York
University, in close collaboration with Ukrainian Catholic University
in Lviv, Ukraine.  Its goals are to help build research capacity in
Ukraine, both generally in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and specifically in the critically important area of
Responsible AI, and to catalyze the integration of Ukrainian
researchers into the global research community.</p>

<p>In Fall 2024, 39 Ukrainian students mentored by 29 academic experts from
universities in the United States and Europe will present their research projects to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7tBBcO1JIM">Watch previous showcases</a> to learn
more about their expecting work on algorithmic fairness,
interpretability and explainability, privacy and data protection, data
management for machine learning, causal inference, and evaluation and
benchmarking.</p>

<p><a href="https://ucu.edu.ua/en/">Ukrainian Catholic University</a> (UCU) launched, in collaboration with the <strong>Center for Responsible AI</strong> at NYU, a long-awaited series of meet-ups on the topic of Responsible AI.</p>

<p>The goal was to invite individuals who contribute to the advancement of responsible AI development and its practical applications. The first meeting was led by <a href="https://airesponsibly.net/people/denys/">Denys Herasymuk</a>, one of the first research fellows in the <a href="https://airesponsibly.net/RAIforUkraine/">#RAIforUkraine</a> program. Тhe second event, on November 28, will feature <a href="https://ua.linkedin.com/in/mariana-romanyshyn-b5896529">Mаriana Romanyshyn</a>, Area Tech Lead at the Ukraine-founded cloud-based typing assistant, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="john-doe-meets-jane-doe-text-anonymization-for-responsible-natural-language-processing">John Doe meets Jane Doe: Text Anonymization for Responsible Natural Language Processing</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
How can we effectively work with user-generated texts without compromising user data privacy? In this talk, we will discuss text anonymization as a responsible AI practice designed to protect sensitive user data while maintaining the usability of data for research and application purposes. We will explore text anonymization use cases, types of anonymization, implementation techniques, and anonymization benchmarks, as well as language-specific nuances of text anonymization. With this talk, my goal is to empower the Natural Language Processing community to embrace methodologies that balance innovation with privacy, fostering a data landscape that is not only advanced but also ethically sound.</p>

<p>A big thank you to <strong>Tetiana Zakharchenko</strong> for co-hosting and organizing the event!</p>

<p>The meet-up is set for <strong>November 28 at 6:00 PM in Kyiv and online</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="responsible-approaches-to-missing-value-imputation-and-model-selection-in-machine-learning">Responsible Approaches to Missing Value Imputation and Model Selection in Machine Learning</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
The talk covers my experience in the “RAI for Ukraine” program and highlights our research on responsible AI, focusing on advancements aimed at ensuring the stability and fairness of machine learning models. I will begin by sharing key insights and accomplishments from my time in the program, followed by a brief introduction to model stability and uncertainty quantification. Next, I will highlight the challenges of incorporating these dimensions of model performance into the model selection process. Building on this foundation, I will introduce our comprehensive software library for model auditing and responsible model selection, called Virny, along with an interactive tool called VirnyView. Finally, I will present our Shades-of-Null benchmark for responsible missing value imputation. This large-scale empirical study, involving 23,940 experimental pipelines, provides a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of various families of imputation methods on a wide range of evaluation metrics, in plausible and socially meaningful missingness scenarios.</p>

<p>The talk is based on two papers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Denys Herasymuk, Falaah Arif Khan, and Julia Stoyanovich: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3654738">Responsible Model Selection with Virny and VirnyView</a> (SIGMOD’24);</li>
  <li>Falaah Arif Khan, Denys Herasymuk, Nazar Protsiv, Julia Stoyanovich: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07510">Still More Shades of Null: A Benchmark for Responsible Missing Value Imputation</a> (working paper).</li>
</ul>

<p>A big thank you to <strong>Tetiana Zakharchenko</strong> for co-hosting and organizing the event!</p>

<p>The next meet-up is set for <strong>November 28 at 6:00 PM in Kyiv</strong>, and it will feature <strong>Mariana Romanyshyn</strong>, Area Tech Lead at <strong>Grammarly</strong>. Stay tuned for further details!</p>
