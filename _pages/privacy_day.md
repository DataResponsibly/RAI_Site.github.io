## NYC Privacy Day, Spring 2024

{% include figure.html people-profile=false path="/assets/img/banner/privacy_robot.png" class="img-fluid" width="100px" robot=true %}
<br>

We are excited to host the NYC Privacy Day at New York
University. This is an in-person event.  The format will be similar to
the [Fall 2023 NYC Privacy Day](https://rachelcummings.com/nyc-privacy-day/), but with a few
additions.  We will have invited talks, contributed posters (with
in-person voting for the best poster award!), good food, and a lot of
NYC area privacy folks to chat and network with!

### Poster Session

When you RSVP, you will have the opportunity to register your interest in giving a poster. This can be a recent poster from a conference, a new poster on work in progress, or even a proposal poster on a project you are thinking about starting. 

**We will be presenting a best poster award based on realtime votes from attendees.**

**RSVP sooner to increase your chances of presenting a poster!**

*Further Details: We have limited space for posters, so depending on interest will make a selection so as to represent the greatest variety of submissions. We cannot accomodate poster print requests, so please bring your own poster, but we will provide boards and easels.*
