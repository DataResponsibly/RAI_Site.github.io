## Poster Session

When you RSVP, you will have the opportunity to register your interest in giving a poster. This can be a recent poster from a conference, a new poster on work in progress, or even a proposal poster on a project you are thinking about starting. 

**We will be presenting a best poster award based on realtime votes from attendees.**

**RSVP sooner to increase your chances of presenting a poster!**

*Further Details: We have limited space for posters, so depending on interest will make a selection so as to represent the greatest variety of submissions. We cannot accomodate poster print requests, so please bring your own poster, but we will provide boards and easels.*
