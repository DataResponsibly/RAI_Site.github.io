## Findings for Lab 12
Findings extracted from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032723001118), see Brightspace for annotated PDF (cannot host here due to copyright).

### Undergraduate course
Please select **one** of the following findings to attempt to replicate as part of your lab submission.
1. "At both Wave I and Wave II, X % of the sample scored ( \geq 9 ) on the 11-item CES-D, which corresponds to a score of ( \geq 16 ) on the 20-item version (Kohout et al., 1993), used to define clinically elevated depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977)."
2. "Marital satisfaction and life events were significantly correlated with depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up."
3. "X \% of the sample scored \( \geq 9 \) on the CES-D at Wave IV and Y \% did so at Wave V."
4. "Marital satisfaction and life events were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the cross-sectional analysis (Table 1). *(use Pearson correlation)*"

### Graduate course
Please select **one** of the findings from the "Undergraduate course" section above and **one** of the findings from below to attempt to replicate as part of your lab submission.
1. "There were X women and Y men who completed measures at both waves; their mean age was Z years (SD = ?); they had been married an average of N years (SD = ?); and the sample was I \% White, J \% Black, and K \% other." 
2. "Results from regression analyses predicting follow-up depressive symptoms, adjusting for baseline depressive symptoms, indicated both marital satisfaction, \( B = -X \), \( SE = ? \), \( \beta = ? \), \( p < ? \), and number of life events, \( B = Y \), \( SE = ? \), \( \beta = ? \), \( p < ? \), were each significantly associated with follow-up depressive symptoms in separate analyses."
3. "Next, when marital satisfaction and life events were entered simultaneously in predicting follow-up depressive symptoms, adjusting for baseline depressive symptoms, both predictors were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms (Table 2, Model 1), thereby providing evidence for the specificity of these associations."
4. "Finally, when the Satisfaction x Stress interaction term was added to the equation (Table 2, Model 2), it was not significantly associated with follow-up depressive symptoms, indicating that marital satisfaction did not buffer the association between life events and follow-up depressive symptoms."
