AI presents challenges and opportunities that require an interdisciplinary approach, and that's where our strength lies. At the Center for Responsible AI, we foster an environment of collaboration where diverse minds come together, leveraging the richness of their varied perspectives. Whatever your academic or policy background, there are numerous ways to engage with us.

The ongoing war in Ukraine has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, including many university students. The Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) in Lviv, has been active in their attempts to keep the students engaged and to allow them to successfully complete the academic year. To support these efforts, NYU’s Center for Responsible AI (R/AI) collaborated with UCU to recruit 18 research fellows–Ukrainian graduate and advanced undergraduate students– and host a 6-week long Summer Research Program.
