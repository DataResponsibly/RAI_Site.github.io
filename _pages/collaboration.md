<!-- <h3 class="category" id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3> -->

AI presents challenges and opportunities that require an
interdisciplinary approach, and that's where our strength lies. At the
Center for Responsible AI, we foster an environment of collaboration
where diverse minds come together, leveraging the richness of their
varied perspectives. Whatever your academic or policy background,
there are numerous ways to engage with us.

<h4 class="category" id="ucu">Responsible AI research program with Ukrainian Catholic University</h4>

The ongoing war in Ukraine has displaced hundreds of thousands of
people, including many university students. The Ukrainian Catholic
University (UCU) in Lviv, has been active in their attempts to keep
the students engaged and to allow them to successfully complete the
academic year. To support these efforts, NYU’s Center for Responsible
AI (R/AI) collaborated with UCU to recruit 18 research
fellows–Ukrainian graduate and advanced undergraduate students– and
host a 6-week long Summer Research Program.
