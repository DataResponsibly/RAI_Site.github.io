{% include figure.html people-profile=false path="/assets/img/events/nyaiexchange_banner.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="850px" robot=false %}
<br>

**The rapid pace of AI adoption is reshaping society and raising urgent questions about its impact and direction. The NY AI Exchange is our response: a hub for bold ideas, shared insight, and collective action.**

Launching in Fall 2025, the Exchange will bring together educators, researchers, technologists, policymakers, artists, and community leaders for meaningful dialogue and hands-on engagement. Our goal is to create an open, collaborative space where AI‚Äôs impact and place in society are challenged, defined, and reimagined. 

#### Formats and Themes

Throughout the year, we will host in-person events at NYU and venues across New York City, each focused on a distinct topic connected to AI‚Äôs influence on everyday life. These sessions will combine expert perspectives with opportunities for community dialogue, bringing voices from education, research, technology, policy, and local communities. From interactive workshops and academic forums to policy discussions and live demos, events will explore themes such as:  

- **AI, Demystified:** Engaging sessions to help non-technical audiences understand and challenge AI systems that affect their lives
- **Community Dialogues:** Candid conversations on ethics, risks, and real-world impact of AI in critical domains like education, hiring, healthcare, and beyond
- **Workshops & Demos:** Interactive sessions led by researchers, showcasing transparency, fairness, and accountability tools
- **R/AI for Businesses:** Practical workshops for startups and SMBs on AI adoption, compliance, risk, and transparency
- **AI & Creativity:** Live performances, screenings, and exhibitions that blend art and AI
