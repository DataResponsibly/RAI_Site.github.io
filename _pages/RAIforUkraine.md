<!-- <h4 class="category" id="collaboration">#RAIforUkraine: Responsible AI Research for Ukrainian Scholars</h4> -->

The ongoing war in Ukraine has severely disrupted the lives of
hundreds of thousands of people, significantly impacting university
students by displacing many and interrupting their education.  To
address this, NYU R/AI launched **\#RAIforUkraine**, a fully remote
academic research program in partnership with the <a
href="https://ucu.edu.ua/en/">Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)</a>
in Lviv, Ukraine.  In the short term, the program aims to provide a
sense of normalcy, and high-quality research opportunities, to
students in Ukraine.  Its long-term goal is to strengthen Ukraine's
research capacity in responsible AI.

**#RAIforUkraine** launched in June 2022, and has been running on the
academic calendar (September through August) since Fall 2023.  The
program is open to advanced undergraduate and graduate students who live in
Ukraine and are enrolled in degree programs in computer science,
information systems and related fields at accredited Ukrainian
universities.  These students—**RAI Research Fellows**—are
mentored by academic researchers from U.S. and European universities,
and conduct cutting-edge collaborative research on a range of
responsible AI topics.  Students receive academic credit and
competitive stipends.

Financial support for the program is provided by NYU R/AI, and by
generous contributions from [Simons
Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) and from the [NYU Office of
Global
Services](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/office-of-the-provost/university-life/office-of-studentaffairs/office-of-global-services.html). **Click <a href="https://www.givecampus.com/campaigns/25654/donations/new?designation=thecenterforresponsibleai">here</a> to support #RAIforUkraine!**

This was very different from my previous experience and taught me to think out of the box and be brave with my ideas! The program is a great opportunity for young students to try themselves in real high-quality research, which is incredibly important for Ukrainian academia."</i>
