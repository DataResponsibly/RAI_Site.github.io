He has also been a TA for the responsible data science course at NYU. Raphael is also part of the Algorithms and Foundations group at NYU, working on designing fast algorithms for numerical linear algebra.

Before joining NYU, he finished an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Purdue University in 2019. In his spare time, Raphael likes to study new recipes to cook and to spend many hours talking about TV. rHe can generally be found at his desk with a mug full of some esoteric tea.
