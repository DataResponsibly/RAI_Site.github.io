Umang Bhatt is Faculty Fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University.  His research interests lie in trustworthy machine learning, responsible artificial intelligence, and human-machine collaboration. Much of his research concerns operationalizing algorithmic transparency within organizations. To accomplish this, he has hosted several convenings to identify gaps in the explainable machine learning landscape, built methods for filling those gaps, and validated those methods with large scale human subject experiments. Umang is currently building tools for routing decision-makers to appropriate forms of decision support and for capturing how AI systems are used in decision-making contexts. 

Currently, he is a Research Associate at the Alan Turing Institute, an Advisor to the Responsible AI Institute, and an Associate Fellow at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence. He completed his PhD in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge. His PhD research was funded by DeepMind and Leverhulme Trust. Previously, He was Fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University, a Fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, and the first Research Fellow at the Partnership on AI. He completed a joint bachelors-masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
