Lucius is a PhD Candidate at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) advised by [Julia Stoyanovich](https://stoyanovich.org/) as part of the Center for Responsible AI and working closely with [Joshua Loftus](https://joshualoftus.com/) at the London School of Economics. His research focuses on the intersection between responsible data science, causal inference, and inequalityâ€”looking at statistical aspects of inequality problems, the modeling of social categories like race and gender, and techniques that can aid in the responsible and transparent use and analysis of data. His research is generously supported by the [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/2022-recipients/).

Prior to NYU, he worked as a researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in their Applied Statistics and Computational Modeling group. Lucius holds a B.Sc. in Data Science from Harvey Mudd College
