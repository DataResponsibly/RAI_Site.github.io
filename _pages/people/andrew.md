Andrew Bell is a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate being co-advised by Prof. Julia Stoyanovich and Dr. Oded Nov. Andrew is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP). His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and public policy and are more narrowly focused on the fairness and explainability of algorithmic decision systems. In Spring 2023, Andrew was a visiting research fellow at the Center for AI (CENTAI) in Turin, Italy.

In the past, he was a researcher at Data Science for Social Good (DSSG), where he worked on major policy projects like working with a European countryâ€™s National Institute of Public Health to develop predictive models that can identify children at risk of not being vaccinated for Measles, Mumps and Rubella. Andrew has also worked at Solve for Good, and the policy research institute MDRC. He graduated from the Calhoun Honors College at Clemson University with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2015. Andrew's interests outside of work include traveling and art.
