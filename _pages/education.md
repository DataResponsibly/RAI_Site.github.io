Education stands as the cornerstone of our work at the Center for
Responsible AI. Understanding the profound implications of AI on
society necessitates a comprehensive and inclusive approach to
education. We conduct cutting-edge research, offer a wide range of
courses, and develop educational material geared towards students,
professionals, and the broader community. Our goal is to empower
learners with the knowledge and critical thinking skills to actively
shape the trajectory of AI technology.

<h4 class="category" id="rds">Responsible data science for university students</h4>

Responsible Data Science is a technical course that tackles the issues
of ethics, legal compliance, data quality, algorithmic fairness and
diversity, transparency of data and algorithms, privacy, and data
protection. This course was developed and offered for the first time
in [Spring 2019](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/courses/spring19).
Since then, it has been offered every Spring to undergraduate and
graduate students in data science, computer science, and related
disciplines at New York University.

The most recent offering of the course was in [Spring
2023](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/rds23/).  The course will be
offered again in Spring 2024. You can find the most recent lecture
slides, lab notebooks, and readers on the [course
website](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/rds/).  All course
materials are publicly available online.

<h4 class="category" id="playground">The causal inference playground</h4>

[An interactive adventure through foundational causal inference
concepts](https://lbynum.github.io/interactive-causal-inference/). By
the end, you should have a good intuition for Causal Inference and be
able to use the ‘Causal Inference Playground’ in the conclusion to
reinforce causal inference concepts. It's also fun!

### A Stakeholder-first Approach to Creating Transparency for Your Organization's Algorithms 

Welcome to 2033, the year when AI, while not yet sentient, can finally be considered responsible. Only systems that work well, improve efficiency, are fair, law abiding, and transparent are in use today. It’s AI nirvana. You ask yourself: “How did we get here?”

You may have played a major role! As more organizations use algorithmic systems, there is a need for practitioners, industry leaders, managers, and executives to take part in making AI responsible. In our [Algorithmic Transparency Course](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/algorithmic-transparency-playbook/), we provide a playbook, detailing how to influence change and implement algorithmic transparency for your organization’s algorithmic systems.

This course is based on the [Algorithmic Transparency Playbook](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/algorithmic-transparency-playbook/resources/transparency_playbook_camera_ready.pdf), which is a free-guide to algorithmic transparency published by the New York University Center for Responsible AI.

We have hosted a series of our popular  [We Are AI](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/we-are-ai/) workshop with [Queens Public Library](https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/news-media/blog/2482) and Meta. These workshops aim to demystify AI and foster responsible AI use. Together, we're bringing education on AI ethics and practices to a targeted audience, promoting a more informed and inclusive technical workforce.
