Education stands as the cornerstone of our work at the Center for Responsible AI. Understanding the profound implications of AI on society necessitates a comprehensive and inclusive approach to education. We conduct cutting-edge research, offer a wide range of courses, and develop educational material geared towards students, professionals, and the broader community. Our goal is to empower learners with the knowledge and critical thinking skills to actively shape the trajectory of AI technology.

#### An Interactive Introduction to Causal Inference:

[An interactive adventure through foundational causal inference concepts](https://lbynum.github.io/interactive-causal-inference/). By the end, you should have a good intuition for Causal Inference and be able to use the ‘Causal Inference Playground’ in the conclusion to reinforce causal inference concepts. It's also fun!

### A Stakeholder-first Approach to Creating Transparency for Your Organization's Algorithms 

Welcome to 2033, the year when AI, while not yet sentient, can finally be considered responsible. Only systems that work well, improve efficiency, are fair, law abiding, and transparent are in use today. It’s AI nirvana. You ask yourself: “How did we get here?”

You may have played a major role! As more organizations use algorithmic systems, there is a need for practitioners, industry leaders, managers, and executives to take part in making AI responsible. In our [Algorithmic Transparency Course](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/algorithmic-transparency-playbook/), we provide a playbook, detailing how to influence change and implement algorithmic transparency for your organization’s algorithmic systems.

This course is based on the [Algorithmic Transparency Playbook](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/algorithmic-transparency-playbook/resources/transparency_playbook_camera_ready.pdf), which is a free-guide to algorithmic transparency published by the New York University Center for Responsible AI.

We have hosted a series of our popular  [We Are AI](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/we-are-ai/) workshop with [Queens Public Library](https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/news-media/blog/2482) and Meta. These workshops aim to demystify AI and foster responsible AI use. Together, we're bringing education on AI ethics and practices to a targeted audience, promoting a more informed and inclusive technical workforce.
