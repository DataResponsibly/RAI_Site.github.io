We believe our commitment to responsible AI extends beyond academic research and into the policy landscape. 

Meaningful change comes from a robust dialogue among researchers, policymakers, community members, and non-profit organizations. Through lobbying and governmental outreach, we strive to influence AI policies that prioritize fairness, transparency, and the betterment of society. We see ourselves as the bridge that connects the world of AI research with the realms of public policy and community engagement.
