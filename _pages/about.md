We are the Center for Responsible AI at NYU! 

[Responsible AI](), as we see it, is the principled development and application of AI in a way that respects human values, ensures fairness, maintains transparency, and upholds accountability.

We conduct innovative research to that end, in the hopes of navigating the complexities of artificial intelligence and foster its responsible use, promoting its benefits while mitigating its risks.  

**We aim to create a future where AI serves humanity, building technologies that respect and enhance our shared values.**
