**Our goal is to build a future in which responsible AI is synonymous with AI.**  Our work centers around [interdisciplinary research](research/), [technology policy](policy/), and [education and training](education/) for AI practitioners, decision makers, and the public at large.

**What is responsible AI?**  We use this terms to refer to making the design, development and use of AI socially sustainable: using technology for good while controlling the risks.  Responsible AI is about respecting human values, ensuring fairness, maintaining transparency, and upholding accountability.  It's about taking hype and magical thinking out of the conversation about AI.  And about giving people the ability to understand, control and take responsibility for AI-assisted decisions.

<!-- [Responsible AI](), as we see it, is the principled development and application of AI in a way that respects human values, ensures fairness, maintains transparency, and upholds accountability.

We conduct innovative research to that end, in the hopes of navigating the complexities of artificial intelligence and foster its responsible use, promoting its benefits while mitigating its risks.  

**We aim to create a future where AI serves humanity, building technologies that respect and enhance our shared values.**
