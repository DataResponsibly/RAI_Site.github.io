{% include figure.html people-profile=false path="/assets/img/banner/M5-banner.png" class="img-fluid" width="600px" robot=false %}
<br>

#### Workshop Goals and Broad Overview

On July 29-August 1, 2024, an in-person workshop of leading experts in
responsible AI technology and policy will be convened at New York
University, to obtain community feedback regarding policies and best
practices, and inform the development of priorities and policies for
the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot. By convening a
diverse group of stakeholders to offer their perspectives, the
workshop will provide suggestions for improving the trustworthiness of
the resources that are components of the Pilot, and for supporting the
equitable use of these resources by a diverse group of researchers and
students.

This workshop is convened by <a
href="https://airesponsibly.net/people/julia/">Prof. Julia
Stoyanovich</a>, and is co-hosted by the <a
href="https://r-ai.co/">NYU Tandon Center for Responsible AI</a> and
the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/">NYU Center for Data
Science</a>. This workshop is supported by <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2432040">NSF
Award No. 2432040</a> and by <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar
Network</a>.

<!-- This workshop is convened by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and brings together representatives from multiple agencies and sectors to collaborate on the NAIRR Implementation Plan. The NSF leads this initiative through scientific, technical, and operational collaboration with various stakeholders to ensure a robust and effective governance framework for the NAIRR Pilot. -->
