{% include figure.html people-profile=false path="/assets/img/banner/M5-banner.png" class="img-fluid" width="600px" robot=false %}
<br>

### Workshop Goals and Broad Overview

The goal of this workshop is to explore and assess the governance landscape of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) by gathering expert input on opportunities and challenges with respect to the implementation and management of NAIRR. This interactive workshop aims to:

- Develop governance principles and best practices for the NAIRR Pilot.
- Identify evaluation metrics, resource allocation policies, and guidelines for responsible management of data and AI resources.
- Discuss proposed governance structures, highlight case studies, and identify potential areas for improvement.

This workshop is convened by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and brings together representatives from multiple agencies and sectors to collaborate on the NAIRR Implementation Plan. The NSF leads this initiative through scientific, technical, and operational collaboration with various stakeholders to ensure a robust and effective governance framework for the NAIRR.
