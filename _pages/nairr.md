{% include figure.html people-profile=false path="/assets/img/banner/M5-banner.png" class="img-fluid" width="850px" robot=false %}
<br>

#### Workshop Goals and Broad Overview

On July 29-31, 2024, an in-person workshop will be convened at New
York University, bringing together leading experts in the
cyberinfrastructure and AI policy / governance / responsible AI
communities.  The goals of this workshop are to to obtain community
feedback regarding policies and best practices, and inform the
development of priorities and policies for the National AI Research
Resource (NAIRR). By convening a diverse group of stakeholders to
offer their perspectives, the workshop will provide suggestions for
improving the trustworthiness of the resources that are components of
the NAIRR, and for supporting the equitable use of these resources by
a diverse group of researchers and students.

This workshop is convened by <a
href="https://airesponsibly.net/people/julia/">Prof. Julia
Stoyanovich</a>, and is co-hosted by the <a
href="https://r-ai.co/">NYU Tandon Center for Responsible AI</a> and
the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/">NYU Center for Data
Science</a>. This workshop is supported by <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2432040">NSF
Award No. 2432040</a> and by <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar
Network</a>.

<!-- This workshop is convened by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and brings together representatives from multiple agencies and sectors to collaborate on the NAIRR Implementation Plan. The NSF leads this initiative through scientific, technical, and operational collaboration with various stakeholders to ensure a robust and effective governance framework for the NAIRR Pilot. -->
