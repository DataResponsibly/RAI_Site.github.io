The [**Data Synthesizer**](http://demo.dataresponsibly.com/synthesizer/) is a tool that generates privacy-preserving synthetic data, using the framework of differential privacy.  Synthetic data can facilitate collaborations between data scientists and owners of sensitive data, and it can support algorithmic transparency and disclosure.  Use it through a web-based UI, or incorporate it into your python code.
